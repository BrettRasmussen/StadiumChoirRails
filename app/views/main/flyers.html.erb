    <h2>Flyers</h2>

    <p>Here are some flyers that you can use for recruiting purposes.</p>
   
    <p>The ones with "_sm" in the filename are small and in a lower resolution,
    suitable for emailing to others to view them on-screen.  The others are
    higher resolution for printing.  The ones with the "_4" in the file name
    have 4 per page, so they're more useful for printing if you want something
    to cut up and hand out.</p>

    <p>We'll probably adjust them for prettier printing as we go, and we'll be
    making a full-sheet version for posting on walls and bulletin boards
    soon.</p>
