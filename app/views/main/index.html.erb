  <h1>The Stadium Choir</h1>

  <div id="rendered-content">

    <h2>Come sing in the Stadium of Fire!</h2>
    
    <p>This year's choir will have a bigger role than ever before.  We are
    looking for up to to 500 singers!  If you know of other singers, please send
    them to this page.</p>

    <p>We will be singing <em>76 Trombones</em> and <em>Trouble</em> from
    <em>The Music Man</em> and one or two more songs of a patriotic nature, to
    be determined.</p>


    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be of high-school age or older.</li>

      <li>You must be able to hold your own voice part while others are singing
      different parts in the other sections (don't worry&mdash;the sections will not
      be intermingled with each other).</li>

      <li><strong>You must learn your part on your own before the first
      rehearsal</strong> (music available for download from this site soon).</li>

      <li>You must be able to attend all rehearsals.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Rehearsal Schedule</h2>
    <p>The rehearsal schedule will be determined shortly.  It will probably
    entail three or four rehearsals in the last two weeks of June, followed by
    the dress rehearsal at the stadium on July 3rd and then the performance on
    the 4th.  Please revisit this page soon for details.</p>


    <h2>Recording</h2>
    <p>We will be looking for a small group of advanced singers (20 to 40
    voices) from among the choir members who can participate in a prior
    recording session of the music we will sing on the 4th.  This will require
    an audition.  You may indicate your interest in participating in that group
    on the sign-up form.</p>


    <h2>Tickets</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, there will be too many people in the choir to allow for
    each member to get a complimentary ticket for a loved one.  Of course, each
    singer will be given free admission.  We recommend you try to join the choir
    as couples or families (provided all can master their parts).</p>


    <h2>Signing Up</h2>
    <p>The "Sign Up" link to the right will take you to the sign-up page.  You
    may use that form if you are either ready to commit immediately or are
    likely to commit pending clarification of the rehearsal schedule, and for
    the time being would like to be included in the email list for further
    information.  You will be able change your commitment status once the
    schedule is set.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>You may email us at stadium<foo>choir<foo>@<foo>twoedge<foo>.<foo>com
    with any questions you may have.  Please be patient, as there aren't very
    many of us.  We'll try and get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
