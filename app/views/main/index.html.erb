  <h1>The Stadium Choir</h1>

  <div id="rendered-content">

    <h2>Come sing in the Stadium of Fire!</h2>
    
    <p>This year's choir will have a bigger role than ever before, starring in
    the opening sequence and during the flag retirement ceremony at the end.</p>
   
    <p>We need between 300 and 350 voices.  If you know of other singers, please
    send them to this page.</p>

    <p>We will be singing <em>76 Trombones</em>, <em>America the
    Beautiful</em>, <em>Grand Old Flag</em>, <em>God Bless America</em>, and the
    <em>Battle Hymn of the Republic</em>.</p>


    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You must be of high-school age or older.</li>

      <li>You must be able to hold your own voice part while others are singing
      different parts in the other sections (don't worry&mdash;the sections will not
      be intermingled with each other).</li>

      <li>You must memorize your part for <em>76 Trombones</em>, since we will
      have blocking for that number.</li>

      <li>You must be able to attend all rehearsals (exceptions granted on a
      case-by-case basis).</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Rehearsal / Performance Schedule</h2>
    <p>We have the following times scheduled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tuesday, June 16, 7pm-9pm</li>
        <li>Saturday, June 20, 10am-12pm</li>
        <li>Tuesday, June 23, 7pm-9pm</li>

        <li>Saturday, July 4, from about 5 on: Stadium of Fire</li>
      </ul>

    <p>It is possible that if everyone learns all of the music quickly, we can
    cancel one of the first four rehearsals.  If it takes us longer to learn the
    music, there is also the possibility of an additional rehearsal on Tuesday,
    July 2.</p>

    <p><b>REHEARSAL LOCATION:</b>  The first four rehearsals will be held at the
    LDS chapel affectionately referred to as the "Apple" Chapel (because it's
    off of Apple Avenue), about four blocks east of the BYU Creamery on 9th.
    From I-15, take the University Parkway exit by UVU (NOT University
    <em>Avenue</em> by Provo Towne Center Mall) and head east.  Follow
    University Parkway east for several miles, past University Mall, down the
    hill into Provo, past LaVelle Edwards Stadium on the left and the Marriott
    Center on the right, and finally turn right onto 900 East.  Head south about
    four blocks to Birch Lane, the intersection at the Creamery on 9th.  Turn
    left on Birch and go east about four blocks.  As the road curves, and
    immediately past Apple Avenue, there is a church building on the left,
    across from Kiwanis Park.  That's the place.  Rehearsals during the week of
    the performance will all be at the stadium.</p>


    <h2>Recording</h2>
    <p>We will be looking for a small group of advanced singers (around 40
    voices) from among the choir members who can participate in a prior
    recording session of the music we will sing on the 4th.  This will require
    an audition, which will be announced at the first or second rehearsal, as
    well as the recording date.  It will also require participants to know their
    music exceptionally well.  You may indicate your interest in participating
    in that group on the sign-up form.</p>


    <h2>Tickets</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, there will be too many people in the choir to allow for
    each member to get a complimentary ticket for a loved one.  The Stadium
    producers have set aside a few hundred tickets for purchase by members of
    the choir for their loved ones from June 16th through June 22nd, with a
    discount for tickets purchased on the day of June 16th itself.  Of course,
    each singer will be given free admission.  We also recommend you try to join
    the choir as couples or families (provided all can meet the requirements).
    Note that since the choir will perform at various points throughout the
    program, we will be sitting in a designated area, waiting in a holding area
    backstage, or on stage the whole time.  We will most likely not have any
    time to go join loved ones in the main audience.</p>


    <h2>Sheet Music</h2>
    <p>We'll put up sheet music on this site just as soon as we can get it all
    taken care of.  We know it's taking a long time, and we appreciate your
    patience.  All registered members will be notified by email when it becomes
    available.  You will need to print out the sheet music and bring it to the
    rehearsals.</p>


    <h2>Signing Up</h2>
    <p>The "Sign Up" link to the right will take you to the sign-up page.</p>


    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>You may email us at stadium<foo>choir<foo>@<foo>twoedge<foo>.<foo>com
    with any questions you may have.  Please be patient, as there aren't very
    many of us.  We'll try and get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
